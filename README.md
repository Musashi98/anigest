I builded some small components with the React Native animation and gesture handlers libraries. Each component is a screen with some
object that can be actioned in some form:

- MovableSquare: a square that can be moved over the screen. If it's droped outside the circle it will return to the center of the circle.
- ThemeSwitcher: a switcher that changes the theme of the screen when is pressed.
- RotatingFigures: some object in the screen that changes color and shape when pressed while making a smooth rotation.
- BallsMove: four following balls that can be moved over the screen and return to the center when dropped.

To preview one of this components, just need to insert it inside the View tags in MainComponent.tsx.

Thanks to the Reactiive channel on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/c/Reactiive) for showing how this animations and gestures work.
